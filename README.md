# Itso 

## A Simple Static Blog System

It originally came from a piece of code I wrote back in 2017 while learning Flask, and I’ve been using it as the backend for my personal website ever since. I’ve thought many times about abandoning it and rewriting it, since its technical design may no longer fit modern web standards, but due to time constraints I never followed through. Now, however, I’ve made up my mind to start maintaining it.
